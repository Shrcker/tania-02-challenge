# Tania's "Refactor Horiseon" Submission

## Description

This repo is my first homework assignment for OSU's Coding Boot Camp course. I was tasked to refactor pre-written code, making sure to focus on implementing proper HTML semantics while keeping the site's original functionality.

This proved to be a solid exercise for me since it forced me to review a lot about HTML and CSS, especially with the fridge realization of just how much the CSS could be cleaned up from where it started. It was also an apparent opportunity for me to discover how to implement proper SEO into HTML, which I went ahead and tried to do as both practice and to embrace the fantasy of the project: I was assigned to refactor this code from an employer. I figured adding the Schema.org itemlabels and itemscopes would make sense, since this "company" seems to be focused on improving SEO for clients, thought it wouldn't make sense to hire them if their own site's SEO was left unintegrated.

The mental exercise did help me build a lot of confidence with basic HTML and CSS, though, and I'm really glad to have it all finished. Looking forward to similar assignments moving forward!

## Usage

This mock page is meant to emulate an SEO company's landing page where an end user would scroll down to review their services. The header is also the page's navigation, clicking the labels on the top right will scroll the viewport down to the appropriate article.

Please also make sure to review my actual code and leave suggestions for any other ways I could improve it!

## How to Contribute

Please leave comments and issues to suggest further changes to the code. Primarily looking for suggestions for further optimizations or other refactoring techniques you think I should know. Also feel free to download the code yourself to take a crack at it and push if you want to demonstrate your own suggestions.
